        <h1>Why Coding?</h1>
        <p>
I'm an archivist at Special Collections. We're working on expanding our web archiving program, which is how I got interested in coding. There are so many limitations to what the tools we work with can do, but I'm not always sure when the limitations are <emph>really</emph> the tools, and when they're just my lack of knowledge! Taking the Front-End Development Class should hopefully be a great way to build my skills.

        <h1>Why Northwest Arkansas?</h1>
        <p>I'm from Alabama, but school and work have taken me around the county a bit. I'm excited to have settled in Northwest Arkansas, and excited about all the potential opportunities in the region.</p>

                <li>Welcoming community</li>
                <li>And--as I'm increasingly learning--a very active and growing tech and start-up community</li>
